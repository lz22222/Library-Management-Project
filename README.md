# Code execution guide
To execute and use the provided code, ensuring Python and SQLite are installed. Run miniproject.py in the file's directory. The application allows users to log in, register, view profiles, return books, search and borrow books, and pay penalties. Ensure the database schema matches the code's requirements. The default database path is set to "test.db" in the main function, but you can modify this as necessary.
